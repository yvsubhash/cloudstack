7. GENERAL
a. To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Software, Accelerite may request that Licensee 1) allow Accelerite to remotely access Licensee's system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to Accelerite. However, Accelerite is not obligated to provide such assistance unless Accelerite and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which Accelerite agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond Accelerite's warranty obligations in this Agreement. In any event, Accelerite uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, Accelerite may use Accelerite entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes Accelerite to do so.
Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to Accelerite, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide Accelerite access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that Accelerite may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to Accelerite or the loss or disclosure of such information by Accelerite, including those arising out of any third party claims.
b. You may not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer (“Assign”) all or any part of this Agreement without prior written consent from Accelerite, payment to Accelerite of any applicable fees, and compliance with Accelerite's Software license transfer policies and any applicable third party license terms. Any such attempted Assignment will be null and void. Where an authorized Assignment occurs in accordance with this section, Your rights under this Agreement will terminate, and You will immediately deliver the Software and all copies to the Assignee. The Assignee must agree in writing to the terms of this Agreement, and the transferee thereafter will be considered “You” for purposes of this Agreement. You may transfer firmware only upon transfer of the associated hardware.
c. If the Software is licensed for use in the performance of a U.S. Government prime contract or subcontract, You agree that, consistent with FAR 12.211 and 12.212, commercial computer Software, computer Software documentation and technical data for commercial items are licensed under Accelerite’s standard commercial license.
d. To the extent You export, re-export, or import Software, technology, or technical data licensed or provided hereunder, You assume sole responsibility for complying with applicable laws and regulations and for obtaining required export and import authorizations. Accelerite may suspend performance if You are in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.
e. You agree that Accelerite may audit Your compliance with this Agreement. Any such audit would be at Accelerite’s expense, require reasonable notice, and would be performed during normal business hours. If an audit reveals underpayments then You will immediately pay Accelerite such underpayments together with the costs reasonably incurred by Accelerite in connection with the audit and seeking compliance with this section.
f. You agree that Accelerite may use Your name and/or trademark and/or logo on Accelerite’s website, press releases, brochures, reports and in other marketing materials to show You as a customer of Accelerite.
f. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without giving effect to their principles of conflicts of laws.  Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit, or proceeding arising under or related to this Agreement must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and applicable procedural rules of, the State or Federal Court in Santa Clara County, California, and each party irrevocably submits to the sole and exclusive  personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County generally and unconditionally with respect to any action, suit, or proceeding brought by it against the other party. Notwithstanding the above, Accelerite may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.   You and Accelerite agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement.
8. CONSUMER RIGHTS
Non-excludable statutory rights
Consumers in some countries, states or territories may have the benefit of certain statutory rights and remedies under consumer legislation in respect of which Accelerite’s liability cannot lawfully be excluded or limited (“Non-excludable Rights”). If You acquired the Software as a consumer within the meaning of relevant consumer legislation in Your country, state or territory, the provisions of this Agreement (including the disclaimers of warranties, limitations and exclusions of liability) must be read subject to applicable law and apply only to the maximum extent permitted by that applicable law.
